# A crappy script to check how much lines and characters of code you have written

## Note: requires Node.js to be installed. To leave an argument blank and skip it put `""`

## Usage: `node . "<optional file extensions>" "<optional depth>" "<optional directory path>"`

## Example: `node . ".js .json"`
